Playing with Datatypes

Given four different variables of different data types: a (int), b (float), c (double), l (long), d (string).The task is to do step-wise operations as given below:
1. Divide b by c.
2. Divide c by a (cast to int).
3. Add result of step 2 with l.
4. Print the given string, and the 4th (0-based indexing) character of the string both separated by a space.

Input format:
The input consists of five lines.
The first line consists of the string d.
The second line consists of integer a
The third line consists of float b
The fourth line consists of double c
The fifth line consists of long l.

Output format:
The output consists of two lines.
Print the results of the first 3 steps separated by space.
In the next line, print the string and the 4th character of the string, separated by space.


Example:

Input:
face
1
2
3
5

Output:
0.666667 3 8 
face e

Explanation:
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, l = 5,
d = face

b/c = 0.666667
c/a = 3
(c/a)+l = 8
d = face
d[3] = e
```
"""


Answer:
d = input()
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = float(input())
l = int(input())


x = b/c

y = int(c)/a
z = y+l
print("%.1f"%x,int(y),int(z))
print(d,d[3])
